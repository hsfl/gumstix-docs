# Welcome to the gumstix-docs wiki!

We use the gumstix hardware for different HSFL projects. The Gusmtix Overo and Duovero boards come by default with the Yocto system installed (https://www.yoctoproject.org/). We have prepared a wiki page to help students get started on gumstix with Yocto installed.
